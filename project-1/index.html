                <h2>Sardar Patel : The Iron Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    An iron will and nerves of steel earned Sardar the title of<b> Iron Man</b>. The following anecdote, more than any other,
                    throws light on why Patel was honoured with that unusual title. In the midst of his arguments in a court in Anand in
                    <b>1909</b>, Patel received a telegram informing him that his wife was no more. Putting away the telegram in his pocket and
                    taking a few moments to collect himself, Patel nevertheless continued with the cross-examination of a key witness in the
                    case. It was only after the proceedings of the day were completed that Patel revealed the bitter contents of the
                    telegram to everybody's shock. Patel's client had been accused of a murder charge. He would not allow his own grief to
                    come in the way of his client's life. His client was acquitted in the case. For this, his steely determination he has
                    been referred also as a Volcano in Ice.
